        When some people talk about money<br>
        They speak as if it were a mysterious lover<br>
        Who went out to buy milk and never<br>
        Came back, and it makes me nostalgic<br>

    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a>species,
        with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl<sup><a href="www.abc.com">[1]</a></sup></sup> that are originally from
        Southeastern Asia.<br>
        Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
        A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female
        is called a pullet.<br>
        Humans now keep <b>chickens</b> primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
        Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.</p>

    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,
        <sup><a href="www.abc.com">[2]</a></sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens â€“ in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
        literature.
